# RIntroduction

Here you find the materials i used for some workshops on introduction to statistical programming with R. The chapters entail a collection of exercises I considered as helpful to obtain coding skills in R. All contributions, bug fixes, comments,... are welcome!

(P.S.: I'm sorry that i do not have a proper landing page yet.)
