# The data science process

Data visualisation is an important tool for generating and communicating insights.

**Exploratory graphs**: 

* Describing data, detecting patterns and trends.

* Produced instantly using default settings.

**Illustrative graphs**: 

* Illustrating a conclusion, making a convincing argument.

* Require changing graph titles, axis, labels, colors, symbols, adding legends, ... or adding information.

R includes at least three graphical systems: 

1. The **standard graphics** package, 
2. The **lattice** package for Trellis graphs and 
3. The **ggplot2** package based on the idea of the grammar-of-graphics.

In R graphs are build-up in two stages by successively calling graph functions:

1. Creating an (**exploratory**) default graph.
2. **Customizing** and **annotating** the default graph.
