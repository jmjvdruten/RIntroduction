# What is R?

* R is a computer **language** (like C or C++).
* The _R Graphical User Interface_ (RGui for Windows) / _R Application_ (R.app for Mac OS X) is a terminal-like window that communicates with your computer to interpret the commands written in the R-language

**Interesting:** You can also run the code in a UNIX or BASH window by typing the command \texttt{R}.

## Obtaining R:

[cran.r-project.org](https://cran.r-project.org)

# What is an IDE?

* An _Integrated Development Environment_ is an **application** (like Word or Excel).
* It helps you to organize and maintain your code.
* Free available applications:

    * **RStudio** is most commonly used (Windows, Mac OS X)
    * Eclipse with StatET (Windows, Mac OS X)
    * Emacs / Aquamax with ESS (Linux, Mac OS X)
    * Vi, Vim and GVim (Linux)

NOTE! Using Microsoft Word instead of an IDE to write (or save) code is generally a bad idea. Certain keyboard characters, such as quotations “”, are not the same in Word. The difference is largely indistinguishable to the human eye, but will not run in R.

# A Primer on RStudio

RStudio offers...

  * a source code editor that supports direct code execution,
  * workspace management,
  * debugging, syntax-highlighting, intelligent code completion,
  * easy communication with other softwar and plattforms... (and more)
